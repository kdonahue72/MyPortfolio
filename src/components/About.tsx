        I’m a Doctor of Physical Therapy with a background in business administration, now pivoting into healthcare technology with a focus on backend systems and project management. My clinical training gives me a first-hand view of the inefficiencies in healthcare, and I’m driven to help solve them through modern infrastructure and AI-assisted workflows.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I recently earned my PMP certification and will soon begin the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech. Before this pivot, I spent 3 years as an account manager in SaaS, where I led client-facing projects and worked cross-functionally to streamline delivery pipelines and improve retention.

        Outside of work, I’m often lifting, gaming, exploring new tools in health tech, or refining ideas that combine real clinical pain points with scalable backend and product solutions.
