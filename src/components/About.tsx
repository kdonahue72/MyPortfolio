I'm a project manager with a background in SaaS implementation, ops optimization, and cross-functional delivery—now focused on scaling backend systems and execution within the health tech space.      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
With several years of experience leading complex technical and client-facing projects, I've delivered outcomes like reducing onboarding time by 25%, cutting post-deployment support tickets by 30%, and improving throughput in manufacturing by over 20%. My PMP certification reflects my commitment to structure and execution, while my understanding of clinical environments helps me align systems thinking with real-world healthcare needs.      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
Now, I'm focused on bringing that dual fluency—technical project leadership and healthcare operational awareness—to teams building the infrastructure that drives better care at scale. Whether it's implementation, delivery, or internal tooling, I'm passionate about solving the hard problems behind the scenes that make great products and outcomes possible.      </p>
